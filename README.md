# Health-Match-Services

This project displays the use of web services. This is the first time I’ve used Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) framework. I created both the service and the service client. WCF has great features that will be valuable in the future developing web projects. 
Until this semester (Spring 2022), I did not realize how important web services are. I confidently believe I will be able to implement web services for future web applications. It is very rewarding when all the pieces are in the correct places. Then being able to run the created web services program and watching the information post to the correct URL. Very satisfying.
Thankfully, I had great instruction from my professor on how to setup the services. I don’t think web services are a very intuitive process so I would have needed to find other resources if I didn’t have the programming education I did. 
This process has given me insight into how many different components are needed to have successful web development. I plan to implement everything that I have learned into as many web projects I can. I hope to continue my learning in as many ways that I can, whether that is from other people on the jobsite or tutorials, and classes.
